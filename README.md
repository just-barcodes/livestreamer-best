# livestreamer-best

Whenever I use [livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer), I always
use `livestreamer http://stream best` (with the `best` option). This simple
script calls best automatically, so that I can do `live http://stream`.


### Installation

Give permission

```
chmod a+x intall
```

and then run the install with an optional name (default is `live`) for the
script (you will probably need to `sudo` that)

```
./install [name]
```


### Example Usage

Simply copy/paste the stream link after typing `live` (or the name you chose) in
the terminal:

```
live http://www.twitch.tv/day9tv
```
